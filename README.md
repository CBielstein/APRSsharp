APRS# - Modern APRS software for the amateur radio community

## About APRS

The [Automatic Packet Reporting System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System)
is a digital wireless network designed and run by [amateur (ham) radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio)
operators around the world. Introduced in 1980, it is an ad-hoc, multi-hop,
distributed network through which packets are transmitted and retransmitted
between nodes to increase range. Data transmitted through APRS includes
positional information, personal messages, weather station readings, search and
rescue locations, and more. APRS packets are encoded and decoded by amateur
radio devices, specialized hardware or software, or a combination.

## APRS# Project

The protocol has been in use since its introduction in the 1980s
([see the site by the original creator here](http://aprs.org/)) and has seen
various incarnations of encode/decode/visualize software. This project exists
to eventually become a modern user interface for sending, receiving, and
visualizing APRS digital packets in a straight-forward manner.
